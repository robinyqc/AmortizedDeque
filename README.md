# Alternative CPP Containers (ACC)

Some implementations of c++ standard containers,
including `deque`, `vector`, `bitset`, `queue`.
Different to the main trend, we use some other way to implement these, 
and so performs better in some condition.

Now we only achieve deque. The others will come soon.

## Getting Started

The C++ header files are in `/acc` directory. Just move it to your workspace
folder, then include it in your cpp files.
